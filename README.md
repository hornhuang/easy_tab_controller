A user-friendly TabBarController widget for flutter developer.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter
[plug-in package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a specialized package that includes platform-specific implementation code for
Android and/or iOS.

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

The plugin project was generated without specifying the `--platforms` flag, no platforms are currently supported.
To add platforms, run `flutter create -t plugin --platforms <platforms> .` under the same
directory. You can also find a detailed instruction on how to add platforms in the `pubspec.yaml` at https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages#plugin-platforms.

## Installing

This will add a line like this to your package's pubspec.yaml (and run an implicit dart pub get):

```
dependencies:
  easy_tab_controller: ^1.0.1
```

## Using

You can see more information in example

```
    EasyTabController(
      location: WebTabLocation.left,
      tabs: [
        TabItemBuilder(
          icon: Icon(Icons.directions_car),
          title: "Android",
        ),
        TabItemBuilder(
          icon: Icon(Icons.directions_bike),
          title: "iOS",
        ),
      ],
      body:[
        Center(
          child: Text(""),
        ),
        Center(
          child: Text(""),
        ),
